The file fuelconsumption2.pdf is the file I uploaded for the peer evaluation for Coursera regression module.
The file fuelconsumption2.Rmd is the exact Markdown file belonging to this  pdf document.
The fuelconsumption3.Rmd is equal to the fuelconsumption2.Rmd, except I made each chunck readable and uncommented the plots I used to derive conclusions.
The fuelconsumption3.pdf is the  belonging pdf document, so quite longer than the allowed 5 pages.
